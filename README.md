# OpenSea_PolicyChange
Database Scarcity

Abstract:  
The main objective of this project is to study the effect of a policy change introduced by OpenSea in January 2022. It focuses on utilizing the OpenSea API to retrieve data on creators who joined the platform before January, 2022. The project aims to collect information about their collections, examining each collection and its associated assets. Additionally, it seeks to gather activity data for each asset within the collections. By leveraging the OpenSea API, this project enables comprehensive exploration and analysis of creator and asset data, providing valuable insights into the OpenSea platform's ecosystem and the impact of the policy change.
